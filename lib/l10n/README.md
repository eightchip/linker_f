# Localization Files

This directory contains localization files for the application.

## Files

- `app_ja.arb` - Japanese translations (ARB format)
- `app_en.arb` - English translations (ARB format)
- `app_localizations.dart` - Generated localization class (DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY)
- `app_localizations_ja.dart` - Generated Japanese localization (DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY)
- `app_localizations_en.dart` - Generated English localization (DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY)

## Generating Localization Files

To regenerate the localization files after modifying ARB files, run:

```bash
flutter gen-l10n
```

## Note

The generated files (`app_localizations*.dart`) are committed to the repository to ensure they are available when building the application.
